# 2016 California Contributors plots

I will explore the top cities in highest amounts raised in political contributions in California during the 2016 US Presidential election.

First, I will read the two dataframes
```{r, load_CA_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
# vroom() used to read data because we are dealing with a large dataset
CA_contributors_2016 <- vroom::vroom(here::here("data","CA_contributors_2016.csv"))
zips_df <- vroom::vroom(here::here("data", "zip_code_database.csv"))
glimpse(CA_contributors_2016)
glimpse(zips_df)
```
## Data Wranlging

Only the zip codes of California are required. Specifically, I want to know the primary cities corresponding to the zips
```{r}
zips_CA <- zips_df %>%
  filter(state == "CA") %>%  #filter for CA
  select(zip, primary_city) #retain only zips and primary city
glimpse(zips_CA)
```

Since we do want to see which city does each zip correspond to, we need to join the two dataframes. Then, we group the output table on candidates names, and on cities. After this, we compute the sum of contributions and filter on the respective candidates.

```{r}
zips_num<- mutate(zips_CA, zip = as.numeric(zip)) #convert strings to numerical values so their type matches up with CA_contributers_2016 dataset
df <- inner_join(CA_contributors_2016, zips_num, copy = FALSE) %>% #join two dataframes
  group_by(cand_nm, primary_city) %>%
  summarise(total_contb = sum(contb_receipt_amt)) %>%
  filter(cand_nm %in% c("Clinton, Hillary Rodham", "Trump, Donald J.")) %>% #filter on these 2 candidates (but more candidates can be chosen)
  arrange(desc(total_contb)) 
# Show first 10 results
kable(head(df, 10))
  
```
## Plotting 

I chose the method that displays the same type of graph for multiple candidates. In this example, I filtered on just the 2 candidates (Hillary and Trump). If it would be desirable to analyse info of more than two candidates, the relevant ones can simply be added to the filter statement.

```{r}
df %>%
    #select top 10 cities according to contributions for each candidate
    group_by(cand_nm) %>% 
    top_n(10) %>%
    ungroup %>%
    
    #reorder primary cities by total_contb, within the cand_nm category
    mutate(primary_city = reorder_within(primary_city, total_contb, cand_nm)) %>%
    
  
    #produce plot
    ggplot(aes(primary_city, total_contb, fill = cand_nm)) +
  
    #bar plot
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
    
    #create facet plots
    facet_wrap(~cand_nm, scales = "free") + #the second argument allows the x and y scales to vary across panels
    coord_flip() + # to reverse the barplot
    scale_x_reordered() +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = .05), #add white margin around bars
                       labels=scales::dollar_format(), #add dolar to x scale numbers
                       breaks = breaks_extended(n=4) ) + #uses breaks to display fewer numbers on the x scale 
    
    #aesthetics
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("#2E74C0", "#CB454A")) + #add the exact same colours
    theme_bw() + #add black frame
    theme(aspect.ratio = 1/1.1) + # to adjust the length and width ratio of the table 
    labs(y = "Amount raised",
         x = NULL,
         title = "Where did candidates raise most money?") +
    theme(title = element_text(size=7), #adjust font size
          axis.text=element_text(size=7),
          axis.title=element_text(size=7))
```

As we can see from the graph, Clinton raised most money from San Francisco while Trump raised most from Los Angeles during the 2016 US Presidential election.
